# Ludum Dare 44 : Your life is a currency

[Hello there !](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdwc&t=8) Please take a seat and freak out in front of this repository.

This game was not finished and therefor not published for Ludum Dare 44 :D

It was made with a [classmate](https://github.com/Tenebreizh) to introduce him to the madness that Ludum Dare is. We also took this time to learn a little bit of Unity.

## Cyber RGPD : Order 11-13

The game takes place in San Francisco in a nearish cyberpunk future.
Everyone is implanted with a device that let them broadcast the Internet directly to their eyes !
Accept random RGPD popups without reading them to earn a little bit of money (Is it really worth it ?).

Foofle, Anazon and Headbook are huge corporations that control the world. Try not to die to their crawlers, drones and infiltred lizard aliens !

## How to play

- Click anywhere to shot
- WASD / Arrow keys to move.
